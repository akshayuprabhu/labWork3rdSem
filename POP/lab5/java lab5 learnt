Lessons learnt in java lab5

1. while declaring interface dont use public as mentioned below
		public interface a{
			//some method
		}

because by default every interface has public as its access specifier,but if you mention that you will get an error:<identifier expected>
		public interface a{
			//some method
		}

2.in the class that is implementing the interface compusorily write the <access specifier> along with <return type> for the methods of interfaces defined in the class;

3.consider four interfaces whose hierarchy is like                   a
                     /   \
                    b     c
                     \   /
                       d
in this case b and c extends a {IMP:dont define the functions of a in B and C}

4.all the methods inside an interface are public by default
