1.  string comparisio in bash can be done .
    if [[ "String1" == "String2" ]]; then
        #do this
    fi

    but,if you have to compare strings which are already stored in some variable
    then #dont put the Double Quotes for the variables

        if [[ String1 == String2 ]]; then
            #statements
        fi

2.if you have to store all the files in the current directory
    in a file ,then use :
                        $ls -p | grep -v / > listf
3.to put all the directories in a  file thjen use:
                        $ls -d */ > listd

4.to check if the file is in directory or not use:
                    $if [[ -f <filename> ]]; then
                        #statements
                    fi
4.to check if the given directory is in the current directory or not use:
                    $if [[ -d <directoryname> ]]; then
                    #statements
                    fi
